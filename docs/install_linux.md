# Installing gh on Linux and BSD

Packages downloaded from https://cli.github.com or from https://github.com/cli/cli/releases
are considered official binaries. We focus on popular Linux distros and
the following CPU architectures: `i386`, `amd64`, `arm64`, `armhf`.

Other sources for installation are community-maintained and thus might lag behind
our release schedule.

## Official sources

### Debian, Ubuntu Linux, Raspberry Pi OS (apt)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
